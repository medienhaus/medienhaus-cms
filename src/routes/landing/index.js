          The Rundgang platform will go online on July 5, 2023. For this reason, if possible, all key data of the Rundgang projects should be entered no later than July 4, 2023, 23:59. Format, date, time, location, short description and (preliminary) title are sufficient for now. All other details (descriptive texts, images, videos, etc.) can be updated successively and until the Rundgang.

Requests must be received at least 14 days prior to the Rundgang weekend so that needs and feasibility can be assessed.

          Preview function of the projects: The Rundgang platform will be opened to the public on July 5. A preview of the created projects is unfortunately not possible before that for technical reasons. The design of the pages is already fixed and is currently being implemented for the Rundgang website.
